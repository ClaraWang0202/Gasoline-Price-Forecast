# Gasoline-Price-Forecast-R

## Used historical gas price per week to forecast gas price in the future throughout different states.
data source :https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_pri_gnd_dcus_r10_w.htm
## Fitted time series models (autoregressive (AR),ARIMA) to predict price in R and applied the optimal time window length.
## Implemented Monte Carlo simulations to test the models and computed mean squared error.
## Found best model (GARCH(2,1)(generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity))in our study.
